### What it does  
Allows you to change the gravity with the press of a button.  
It reads \[Game Root Folder\]\UserData\GravityConfig.json to check for what gravity to set when what key is pressed.  

### How to use  
By default you press ctrl+p to set gravity to 0,0,0 (no gravity), and hold ctrl+o to set the gravity to 0,9.81,0 (float upwards)  
Each is toggled independently, so pressing ctrl+p -> (hold) ctrl+o -> (release) ctrl+o will set the gravity to 0,0,0, and pressing ctrl+p -> (hold) ctrl+o -> ctrl+p will keep it at 0,9.81,0

The config file has the fields:  
**gravity:** What gravity to set. It's possible to set diagonal or sideways gravities too.  
**trigger:** What key to press to toggle this gravity. If this is set to None then this entry is disabled  
**hold:** What key needs to be held for the trigger to activate. If set to None then only the trigger is used.  
**holdToActivate:** If set to true, then the gravity is toggled on when Trigger is held down, and off when Trigger is released
